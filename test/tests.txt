Test Programs
Test 00 - Simple return statement program
Test 01 - Simple printing (prints VIC)
Test 02 - Simple loop using printing algorithm in Test 01
Test 03 - Simple program that takes W,A,S,D keyboard input and outputs a value depending on key pressed. Use Q to quit program.
Test 04 - Simple random number generation using a hardcoded seed value and data from one of the VIC registers. Outputs a character (changes if you change the seed) then quits
Test 05 - Program that changes text, background, and border colour of VIC 20 console
Test 06 - Simple sound test with keyboard input.  Uses W,A,S,D to play sounds, Q to quit.
Test 06-1 - Simple sound test with keyboard input.  Uses W,A,S,D to play sounds, Q to quit.
Test 07 - Changing the character layout of the vic-20. We can use this for graphics or level design. By defining our own graphics characters. For example, try hitting m (shows up as a black square instead of an M). Use enter to quit
Test 08 - Simple mirrored play field using characters
Test 09 - Tests basic left/right character movement, based on code from tests 03 and 07.  Uses A and S as input to move left/right.
Test 09-1 - Simple collision detection, extension of test 09.  Use W,A,S,D to move, Q to quit.
Test 09-2 - Expanded test 09, included movement of up and down (W and S).  Only goes from 0-255, so not entire screen.  Use W,A,S,D to move, Q to quit.  Todo: expand to full screen.
Test 10-1 - Simple collision animation based off Test 09-2.  Character 'B' changes colour and bounces back when it collides with 'C'. W,A,S,D to move, Q to quit.


TODO
