Test programs:

To assemble any of the test programs, cd to the test directory and then run:
dasm [test_name].asm -o[test_name].prg where [test_name] is the name of the test you wish to assemble
Then, run the test program by dragging the resulting prg file onto the xvic emulator window, double clicking the prg file, or running xvic [test_name].prg from terminal.

Alternatively, run any of the pre-assembled prg files in the prg directory in the same fashion as above (without needing to assemble them)
