To Do

(3x3 8 layouts) //CD (Done)
-Game loop //Apparently this is done
-Convert all drawing and collision routines     // LM partial work started in my local files, needs a game loop to work properly
-Game loop
-Convert all drawing and collision routines     // LM partial work started in my local files, needs a game loop to work properly KM -> did basic collision stuff but can overwrite it, see demo02-4
-Convert all levels to new level layout routine //CD (Done)
-Change seed to random based on timer //CD (Done)
-"Random" level layouts //CD (Done)
-get doors working again and random level changing/level changing for doors //CD will do this tomorrow. Just a matter of moving existing code into new door collision routine
-subroutines/what to do with items
-Enemy movement (some code for this exists in demo02-5)  (LM - see new branch, may be of some use)
-Enemy health by colors //KM -> DONE
-enemy lose health when hit by attack //KM -> DONE
-Swords and potions and and enemy damage (different color). //CD start on swords, portal and potion positioning. Portals and potions are straightforward, swords shouldnâ€™t be too bad, just need to swap sprites or do some sort of animation when attacking
-Moving floors (loop the code) - this works with portal animation, but just need to keep track of floor level
-Difficulty settings
-Custom character set //CD will work on designing some characters and creating some test code to print them
-Sound for in game events - see SoundTest.asm file; can be incorporated in once movement is complete //KM -> IN PROCESS

LM - add mod    // LM done, untested feel free to let me know if its busted
  - update code that was protecting Y from the evil draw methods killing Y
  - try timer stuff (is high byte of timer 4.2 ish seconds? (256 jiffies))
    - if timer is successful add new time based movement code to game loop
  - change portal method to choose one room (mod 8 + 1) that is not the room the player starts in
